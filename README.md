# DB_Score

#cutoff=x;defining desired cutoff
#% load protein and ligand pdb files
#% calculating protein coordinates,and adding the radius of each atom present in protein
#% calculating ligand coordinates,and adding the radius of each atom present in ligand
#% calculating distances between protein-ligand atom pairs
#% calculating DB_Score with specific cutoff
